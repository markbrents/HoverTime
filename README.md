# HoverTime
One feature I really liked in Windows 10 was being able to click the clock in the corner to quickly see the seconds. Unfortunately, Windows 11 no longer shows seconds on the taskbar clock. To fix that, I created this "Windows 11 Bandage" .

This little tool adds an icon to your system tray. When you hover over it, a tooltip appears showing the current time with seconds included. The display even updates in real time while your mouse is over it.

Note: The live updating feature does not work on Windows 10.
