# HoverTime
One of the things I used to do with Windows 10 was click the clock in the bottom corner to see the seconds. 
Windows 11 doesn't have a clock with seconds.
So I wrote this "Windows 11 Bandage" to make up for it. 
It puts an icon in the system tray. If you hover your mouse over it, it will display a tooltip showing the time, including the seconds. 
And it will update while the mouse is over it. 

Note: the updating doesn't work on Windows 10.
